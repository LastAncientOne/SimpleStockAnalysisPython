# Simple Stock Analysis in Python

#### This is a tutorial for Simple Stock Analysis in jupyter and python. There are two versions for tutorials. One is a jupyter version and the other one is a python. Jupyter also makes jupyter notebooks, which used to be called iPython notebooks.  However, Python is an interpreted high-level programming language. It is very simple and easy to understand for beginners that want to learn about stock analysis and want to become a quant. In addition, this tutorial is for people that want to learn coding in python to analyze the stock market. However, if you already know about stock analyzing or coding in python, this will not be for you. You can check out more advanced coding: https://github.com/LastAncientOne/Stock_Analysis_For_Quant.   

### The order is from #1 through #26.
#### You learn number 1 first and you go in order. Once you have finished, you will know how to write code in python and understand finance and the stock market. :congratulations:

## Prerequistes
Python 3.5+  
Jupyter Notebook Python 3  

## Dependencies  
* fix_yahoo_finance or yfinance  
* TensorFlow 1.10.0  
* Pandas  
* Numpy

* sklearn    
 
 
## How to install library  
### conda install -c ranaroussi yfinance  
### pip install yfinance --upgrade --no-cache-dir    

### Input
Pick a symbol, you want to analyze. 

### symbol = '...' <-- ... input a symbol

Pick a 'start' date and 'end' date for certain time frame to analyze. 

### start = '...' & end = '...' <-- input a date
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
## Examples 
```python
# Libraries
import numpy as np

import fix_yahoo_finance as yf
yf.pdr_override()

# input
symbol = 'AAPL' # Apple Company
start = '2018-01-01'
end = '2019-01-01'

# Read data 
df = yf.download(symbol,start,end)

# View Columns
df.head()
```

## Disclaimer
&#x1F53B; Do not use this code for investing or trading in the stock market. Stock market is unpredictable. :chart_with_upwards_trend: :chart_with_downwards_trend:  However, if you are interest in the stock market, you should read many :books: books that relate to the stock market, investment, or finance. The more books you read, the more you will understand and the more knowledge you gain. On the other hand, if you are into quant or machine learning, read books about :blue_book: finance engineering, machine trading, algorithmic trading, and quantitative trading.
